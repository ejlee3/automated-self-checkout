# Camera Simulator

## Overview

If you do not have a camera device plugged into the system, run the camera simulator to view the pipeline analytic results based on a sample video file to mimic real time camera video. You can also use the camera simulator to infinitely loop through a video file for consistent benchmarking. For example, if you want to validate whether the performance is the same for 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours, looping the same video should produce the same results regardless of the duration.

## Supported Input Videos

The following simulated camera videos and their respective video outputs are listed in the table below. These are based on an index number in the script that downloads the sample videos. Custom videos will need to add the appropriate index in order to maintain the listed camera numbers.

| Simulated Camera Number | Video                | 
|:------------------------|:---------------------|
| Camera 0                | Coca-Cola Video      |
| Camera 1                | Vehicle-Bike Video   |
| Camera 2                | People Walking Video |
| Camera 3                | Barcode Video        |

!!! Note
    The URL for the simulated camera video will be `rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/camera_X` where X is the simulated camera number.

## Run the Camera Simulator

Follow the steps below to run the camera simulator:

1. Download the video files to the **sample-media** directory:
    ```bash
    cd benchmark-scripts;
    ./download_sample_videos.sh;
    cd ..;
    ```
   
    !!! Example - Specify Resolution and Framerate
        This example downloads a sample video for 1080p@15fps.
        ```bash
           cd benchmark-scripts;
           ./download_sample_videos.sh 1920 1080 15;
           cd ..;
        ``` 
    !!! Note
        Only AVC encoded files are supported.

2. After the video files are downloaded to the **sample-media** folder, start the camera simulator:
    ```bash
    make run-camera-simulator
    ```

3. Wait for few seconds, and then check if the camera-simulator containers are running:
    ```bash
    docker ps --format 'table{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Names}}'
    ```

    !!! Success
        Your output is as follows:
    
        | IMAGE                                              | STATUS                   | NAMES             |
        | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |-------------------|
        | openvino/ubuntu20_data_runtime:2021.4.2            | Up 11 seconds            | camera-simulator0 |
        | aler9/rtsp-simple-server                           | Up 13 seconds            | camera-simulator  |
    
    
        !!! Note
            There could be multiple containers with the image "openvino/ubuntu20_data_runtime:2021.4.2", depending on the number of sample-media video files provided.
    
    !!! Failure
        If all the Docker* containers are not visible, then review the console output for errors. Sometimes dependencies fail to resolve. Address obvious issues and retry.

## Stopping the Camera Simulator

1. The camera simulator may be stopped and cleaned up by running 

    ```bash
    make clean-simulator
    ```
